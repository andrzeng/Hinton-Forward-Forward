This is a compact implementation of Geoffrey Hinton's paper *The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Some Preliminary Investigations* (Hinton, 2022)

To run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

This will begin training the model on the MNIST digit classification task, using the new local loss function used in the paper.

I appreciate all criticisms and feedback. If you have any, please open an issue to let me know
